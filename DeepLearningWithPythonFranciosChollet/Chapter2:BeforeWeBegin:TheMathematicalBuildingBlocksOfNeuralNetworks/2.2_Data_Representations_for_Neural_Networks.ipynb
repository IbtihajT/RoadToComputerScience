In the latter case, it's technically more correct to talk about `a tensor of rank 5` (the rank of a tensor being the number of axes), but the ambiguous notation 5D `tensor` is common regardless. "

    "Video data is one of the few types of real-world data for which you'll need 5D tensors. A video can be understood as a sequence of frames, each frame being a color image. Because each frame can be stored in a 3D tensor (*height*, *width*, *color-depth*), a sequence of frames can be stored in a 4D tensor (*frame*, *height*, *width*, *color-depth*), and thus a batch of different videos can be stored in a 5D tensor of shape (*samples*, *frames*, *height*, *width*, *color-depth*).\n",
    "For instance, a 60-second, 144 x 256 YouTube video clip sampled at 4 frames per second would have 240 frames. A batch of four such video clips would be stored in a tensor of shape (4, 240, 144, 256, 3). That's a total of 106,168,320 values! If the *dtype* of the tensor was *float32*, then each value would be stored in 32 bits, so the tensor would represent 405 MB. Heavy! Videos you encounter in real life are much lighter, becaues they aren't stored in *float32*, and they're typically compressed by a large factor (such as in the MPEG format)."
