    "As you saw in the previous section, each neural layer from our first network example transforms its input data as follows\n",
    "```\n",
    "output = relu(dot(W, input) + b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression, `W` and `b` are the tensors that are attributes of the layer. They're called the *weights* or *trainable parameters* of the layer (the `kernel` and `bias` attributes, respectively). These weights contain the information learned by the network from exposure to training data.\n",
    "Initially, these weight matrices are filled with small random values (a step called *random initialization*). Of course, there's no reason to expect that `relu(dot(W, input) + b)`, when `W` and `b` are random, will yield any useful representations. The resulting representation are meaningless but they're a starting point. What comes next is to gradually adjust these weights, based on a feedback signal. This gradual adjustment, also called *training*, is basically the learning that machine learning is all about."
