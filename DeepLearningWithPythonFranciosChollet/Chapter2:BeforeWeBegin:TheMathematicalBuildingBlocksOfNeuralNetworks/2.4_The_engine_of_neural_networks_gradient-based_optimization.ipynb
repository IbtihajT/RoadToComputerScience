    "In the previous algorithm, we casually assumed that because a function is differentiable, we can explicitly compute its derivative.

Applying the chain rule to the computation of the gradient values of a neural network gives rise to an algorithm called *Backpropagation* (also sometimes called *reverse-mode differentiation*). Backpropagation starts with the final loss value and works backward from the top layers to the bottom layers, applying chain rule to compute the contibution that each parameter had in the loss value.\n",
    "Nowadays, and for years to come, people will implement networks in modern frameworks that are capable of *symbolic differentiation*, such as TensorFlow. This means that, given a chain of operations with a known derivative, they can compute a gradient *function* for the chain (by applying the chain rule) that maps network parameter values to gradient values. When you have access to such a function, the backward pass is reduced to a call to this gradient function. Thanks to symbolic differentiation, you'll never have to implement the Backpropagation algorithm by hand. For this reason, we won't waste your time and your focus on deriving the exact formulation of the Backpropagation algorithm in these pages.
