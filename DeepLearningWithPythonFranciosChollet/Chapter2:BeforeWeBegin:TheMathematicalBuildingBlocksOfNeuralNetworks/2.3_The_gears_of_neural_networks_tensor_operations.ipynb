    "You just learned that neural networks consist entirely of chains of tensor operations and that all of these tensor operations are just geometric transformations of the input data. It follows that you can interpret a neural network as a very complex geometric transformations in a high-dimensional space, implemented via a long series of simple steps.\n",
    "In 3D, the following mental image may prove useful . Imagine two sheets of colored paper: one red and one blue. Put one on top of the other. Now crumple them together into a small ball. That crumpled paper ball is your input data, and each sheet of paper is a class of data in a classification problem. What a neural network is meant to do is figure out a transformation of the paper ball that would uncrumple it, so as to make the two classes cleanly separable again. With deep learning, this would be implemented as a series of simple transformations of the 3D space, such as those you could apply on the paper ball with your fingers, one movement at a time.\n",

    "Uncrumpling paper balls is what machine learning is about: finding neat representations for complex, highly folded data manifolds. At this point, you should have a pretty good intuition as to why deep learning excels at this: it takes the approach of incrementally decomposing a complicated geometric transformation into a long chain of elementary ones, which is pretty much the strategy a human would follow to uncrumple a paper ball. Each layer in a deep network applies a transformation that disentangles the data a little and a deep stack of layers makes tractable an extremely complicate disentanglement process."
