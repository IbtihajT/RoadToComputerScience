    "Much as any computer program can be ultimately reduced to a small set of binary operations on binary inputs (AND, OR, NOR, and so on), all transformations learned by deep neural networks can be reduced to a handful of *tensor operations* applied to tensors of numeric data. For instance, it's possible to add tensors, multiply tensors, and so on.\n",
    "In our initial example, we were building our network by stacking `Dense` layers on top of each other. A keras layer instance looks like this:\n",

    "`tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')`\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer can be interpreted as a function, which takes as input a 2D tensor and returns another 2D tensor, a new representation for the input tensor. Specifically, the function is as follows (where `W` is a 2D tensor and `b` is a vector, both attributes of the layer):\n",
    "\n",
    "`output = relu(dot(W, input) + b)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unpack this. We have three tensor operations here: a dot product (`dot`) between the input tensor and a tensor named `W`; an addition (`+`) between the resulting 2D tensor and a vector `b`; and, finally, a `relu` operation. `relu(x)` is `max(x, 0)`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**NOTE** Although this section deals entirely with linear algebra expression, you won't find any mathematical notation here. I've found that mathematical concepts can be more readily mastered by programmers with no mathematical background if they're expressed as short Python snippets instead of mathematical equations. So  we'll use Numpy code throughout."

    "Our earlier naive implementation of *naive_add* only supports the addition of 2D tensors with identical shapes. But in the `Dense` layer introduced earlier, we added a 2D tensor with a vector. What happens with addition when the shapes of the two tensors being added differ?\n",
    "When possible, and if there's no ambiguity, the smaller tensor will be *broadcasted* to match the shape of the larger tensor. Broadcasting consists of two steps:\n",
    "1. Axes (called *broadcast axes*) are added to the smaller tensor to match the `ndim` of the larger tensor.\n",
    "2. The smaller tensor is repreated alongside these new axes to match the full shape of the larger tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a concrete example. Consider `X` with shape (32, 10) and `y` with shape (10,). First, we add an empty first axis to `y`, whose shape becomes (1, 10). Then, we repeat `y` 32 times alongside this new axis, so that we end up with a tenor `Y` with shape (32, 10), where Y[i, :] == y for i in range (0, 32). At this point, we can proceed to add X and Y, because they have the same shape.\n",
    "In terms of implementation, no new 2D tensor is created, because that would be terribly inefficient. The repetition operation is entirely virtual: it happens at the algorithmic level rather than at the memory level. But thinking of the vector being repeated 10 times alongside a new axis is a helpful mental model. Here's what a naive implementation would look like: "
